Data details:
IV_3_s2 is a 4-class EEG data set and it in total contains 160 EEG trials recorded from 4 sessions: 40 trials per session.
Each trial contains 4001 samples, in which the first column codes the class of the trial (i.e., 1/2/3/4). The remaining columns
contain samples of the 10 EEG channels. In detail, it starts with 400 samples from channel 1 and ends with 400 samples from channel 10. 
Class 1 contains 40 trials*4001 samples; Class 2 contains 40 trials*4001 samples; Class 3 contains 40 trials*4001 samples and Class 4 contains 40 trials*4001 samples.
