Data details:
II_Ib is a 2-class EEG data set and it in total contains 200 EEG trials recorded from 2 sessions: 100 trials from session 1 and 
100 trials from session 2. Each trial contains 8065 samples, in which the first column codes the class of the trial (i.e.,1/2). 
The remaining columns contain samples of the 7 EEG channels (8064 in total). In detail, it starts with 1152 samples from
channel 1 and ends with 1152 samples from channel 7. 
Additionally, Class 1 contains 100 trials * 8065 samples and Class 2 contains 100 trials * 8065 samples.
